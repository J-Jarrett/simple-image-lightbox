Simple Image Lightbox
=================

Following along to WebDevSimplified YT tutorial. Thank you Kyle.

This lightbox has a grid of 3x3 images, select one by clicking on it, it appears larger and on top of the others with a grayed transparent background, then returns to the grid when you click away.
